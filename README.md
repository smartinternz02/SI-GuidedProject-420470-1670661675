Finding Missing Person Using Deep Learning
Finding Missing Person Using Deep Learning
A deeply disturbing fact about India’s missing children is that while on an average 174 children go missing every day, half of them remain untraceable. The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report which was cited by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in the Parliament (LS Q no. 3928, 20–03–2018), more than one lakh children (1,11,569 in actual numbers) were reported to have gone missing till 2016, and 55,625 of them remained untraceable till the end of the year.
In this scenario, missing case entries are updated with their photocopies in the police station. By using CCTV cameras we can compare each person with the available database and find these people. If the missing person is found in the CCTV Video stream then location which is tagged to the CCTV is sent as an SMS to the police station.
